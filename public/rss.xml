        <description>Hey, I'm Avneesh Agarwal — a developer based in India, passionate about
            building powerful dev tools, contributing to open source, and sharing my learnings
            through writing. Currently, I'm the CTO at Orcas, where we're reshaping equity
            crowdfunding for startups. I've worked across multiple startups as a developer relations
            engineer, full-stack developer, and technical writer, helping teams build, scale, and
            engage with developer communities. When I'm not coding, you'll find me experimenting
            with side projects, writing articles, or diving into something completely random—just
            for the fun of it. Oh, and I'm also a sports enthusiast (fitness freak + nerd combo :p).</description>
