  about:
    "Hey, I'm Avneesh Agarwal — a developer based in India, passionate about building powerful dev tools, contributing to open source, and sharing my learnings through writing. Currently, I'm the CTO at Orcas, where we're reshaping equity crowdfunding for startups. I've worked across multiple startups as a developer relations engineer, full-stack developer, and technical writer, helping teams build, scale, and engage with developer communities. When I'm not coding, you'll find me experimenting with side projects, writing articles, or diving into something completely random—just for the fun of it. Oh, and I'm also a sports enthusiast (fitness freak + nerd combo :p).",
